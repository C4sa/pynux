This project is **NOT** meant to be anything serious, it was only
made for fun and for learning purposes. This repo is a mirror of the
project on my local Gitea server, and it gets pushed here every 5
hours. If you are willing to look into the source code, go ahead, just
make sure to report any issue here if you found any, but check the
latest commit beforehand, so for example if the commit says "not working"
or "needs fix", then please don't go and report the said error. Thanks
and have fun!
